# Discount ASCII Warehouse with ReactJS and Jest

This is a demo app, intended as a guide to writing simple apps using ReactJS, unit tested with Jasmine, and with Jest as the mocking tool.

## Installation

You can clone the repository:

`$ git clone git@github.com:jonathanconway/discount-ascii-warehouse-react-jest`

Then install the dependencies:

`$ npm install`

And then run the solution (launches Grunt, which then spawns NodeJS to serve the files):

`$ npm start`

To run the Jasmine/Jest tests:

`$ npm test`

## Component Diagram

As recommended by the ReactJS team, I broke the UI down into components before building it. You can see the working out of this below.
